As the tasks of WP2 are to deliver the architectural design and implementation plan for the InTaVia platform, which consists of two main components (a linked data service hosting the datasets aggregated from the data providers (see [**WP3**](/work-packages/)) *and* a multi-perspective application layer front-end based on the data service), this document focuses on the design of the overall architecture of the InTaVia platform and the data service (backend), and also presents the results of the discussions about the original design. It also reviews the existing solutions used by the consortium partners and the state of the art in order to make an informed decision on the platform architecture, design guidelines and implementation options.
