This document outlines the central objectives set out in the InTaVia research proposal – building on the findings of WP1 (user requirements) in interaction with key developments and design choices of WP5 (visual analytics studio). It reports progress on the main components of the Visual Analytics Studio (Data and Coordination of Views, Representations, Visual Query Language Text Mining) in relation to various cross-cutting issues raised during this work, in the way that a systematic review of the current state of the art, as our focus area (i.e. visualisation of digital humanities, digital history and cultural heritage data) has managed to do.
