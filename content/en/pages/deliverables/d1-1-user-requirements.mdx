This document provides the basis for the further technical development of the InTaVia platform and its evaluation (see [**WP7**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)). It documents the results of two innovation workshops with scientists and practitioners and a design sprint with all team members of the project consortium, both held during the initial phase of the project. Ten exemplary personas were defined as a first list of ideal users; their associated practices were analysed as requirements for the InTaVia system architecture (see [**WP2**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)), data model (see [**WP3**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)), text mining techniques (see [**WP4**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)) techniques (WP4), methods of visual analysis (see [**WP5**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)) and methods of visual storytelling of visual storytelling (see [**WP6**](https://intavia.eu/work-packages/)).
