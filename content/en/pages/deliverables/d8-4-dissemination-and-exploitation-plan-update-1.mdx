This document updates the InTaVia Dissemination and Exploitation Plan as conceived and drafted during the first phase of the project (Deliverable 8.2, due after M6). It primarily aims to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of the original dissemination and exploitation plans and to reassess the main dissemination and exploitation objectives, target audiences, communication channels and dissemination tools described therein.

It also includes the definitions of the main Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) used to measure the effectiveness of the activities carried out and addresses the most effective set of tools and methods to reach out to the responsible research and innovation (RRI) communities, research funding and performing organisations (RFPOs) and other potential stakeholders.

This deliverable is currently classified as **confidential** and is not available for download.
