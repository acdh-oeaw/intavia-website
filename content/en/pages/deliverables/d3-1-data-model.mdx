This document discusses the InTaVia Data Model (IDM), which is the central point of the project, enabling collaboration between the project partners and as such is critical to the success of the InTaVia project. It will be formulated based on the analysis of the project partners’ prosopographic databases (PDBs) and Europeana as a starting point for object databases (ODBs), taking into account the requirements of the target research community of practice as well as the technical requirements of the other work packages. The data model will allow basic prosopographical and object data from one or more potentially conflicting biographical sources to be expressed with annotated source texts and provenance data.
