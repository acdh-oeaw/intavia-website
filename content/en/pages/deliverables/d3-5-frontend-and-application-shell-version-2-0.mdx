This deliverable (D3.5) describes the design of the InTaVia frontend architecture and the technologies its development is based on. It is a part of the continuous Task 3.2 (Develop a Frontend and Application Shell) and a revised and extended version of deliverable D3.2. To document the frontend architecture in a comprehensive and publicly accessible fashion, this deliverable builds on the content of the preceding D3.2 but enhances it with substantial updates due to our progress on conceptual and technical developments.

This deliverable is **public**.
