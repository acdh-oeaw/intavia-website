This deliverable documents the integration of diverse datasets, requiring a data model to make data reusable and understandable for a large group of users both in machine-processable RDF (Resource Description Framework) format and via a user-interface. Some aspects of this process were discussed in other deliverables (e.g. D3.1). The InTaVia Data Model in RDF (IDM-RDF) was developed iteratively in collaboration between the project partners to meet the requirements of the project partners' source prosopographical databases (PDBs), (b) of Europeana as the basic object database (ODB), (c) of potential users, and (d) of other work packages.

This deliverable is **public**.
