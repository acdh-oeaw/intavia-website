It seems that ever since *literature* has taken shape, the lives and deeds of individuals have been at the heart of what motivates stories and storytelling: both of Homer's epics begin with a focus on *an individual*. Even after historiography emancipated itself from mythographic and ethnographic studies and entered the stage of scientific literature, biography soon followed suit: one of the three great Greek historians, Xenophon, wrote at least two biographical treatises, paving the way for countless great names in the biographical genre.

While it may seem that biography has experienced a period of disengagement from the academic world in recent decades, this couldn't be further from the truth if one looks at central national biographical projects, among many others the Deutsche Biographie, the Österreichische Biographische Lexikon, the National Biography of Finland – and the New Slovenian Biographical Lexicon (NSBL), which is celebrating the tenth anniversary of its first volume this year. Since 2020, InTaVia has been working to connect and harmonise these collections across borders, making them accessible and visible to a wide audience.

The symposium *There's history in all men's lives* will bring together experts from two closely intertwined fields to shed light on biography as a historical genre, as well as on various aspects of cultural heritage, digital humanities and visualisation, in the hope of further strengthening collaboration between them.
